# native_tamper_detector

See references in `android/app/src/main/kotlin`<br/><br/>
You  also use the package [flutter_tamper_detector](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_tamper_detector) to control the status in your flutter app.<br/>
In `MainActivity.kt` the `IsDebug.check(this)` function is commented out, as this would not allow you to run your app in debug mode. To test, go to `MainActivity.kt`, remove the comment and test.
